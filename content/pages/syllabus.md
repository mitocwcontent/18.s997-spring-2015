Course Description
------------------

This course offers an introduction to the finite sample analysis of high-dimensional statistical methods. The goal is to present various proof techniques for state-of-the-art methods in regression, matrix estimation and principal component analysis (PCA) as well as optimality guarantees. The course ends with research questions that are currently open.

Schedule
--------

*   Sub-Gaussian Random Variables - 2 weeks
*   Linear Regression - 3 weeks
*   Misspecified Linear Models and Nonparametric Regression - 2 weeks
*   Matrix Estimation - 3 weeks
*   Minimax Lower Bounds - 3 weeks

Notes
-----

This course has no required or recommended textbooks but [notes]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/lecture-notes) are provided.
